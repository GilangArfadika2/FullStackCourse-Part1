# Full Stack Open 2025 – Part 1 Submission

This repository contains my solutions for **Part 1** (Introduction to React) of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course offered by the University of Helsinki.

## ✅ Completed Exercises

I have completed and submitted exercises **1.1 to 1.10**.  
Each exercise is saved in its own folder and contains a separate Vite project inside the `introdemo` subdirectory.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to the exercise number and title. Inside each, you'll find a Vite project that includes the source code for that specific exercise.

Example folder layout:

<pre><code> 
part1/ 
├── 1.1 and 1.2/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.3 Course Information step 3/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.4 Course Information step 4/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.5 Course Information step 5/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.6 unicafe step 1/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.7 unicafe step 2/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.8 unicafe step 3/ 
│ └── introdemo/ 
├── 1.9 & 1.10 unicafe step 4 & 5/ 
│ └── introdemo/ </code></pre>

## ▶️ How to Run a Project

To run any of the exercise projects:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the target exercise folder. For example:

   ```bash
   cd "part1/1.4 Course Information step 4/introdemo"
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```bash 
    npm install
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev


Thanks for reviewing my Part 1 submission!
